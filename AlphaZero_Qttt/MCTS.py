        has the maximum upper confidence bound as in the paper.
        Once a leaf node is found, the neural network is called to return an
        initial policy P and a value v for the state. This value is propagated
        up the search path. In case the leaf node is a terminal state, the
        outcome is propagated up the search path. The values of Ns, Nsa, Qsa are
        updated.
        NOTE: the return values are the negative of the value of the current
        state. This is done since v is in [-1,1] and if v is the value of a
        state for the current player, then its value is -v for the other player.
